# Handwritten digit classifier

The app is a handwritten digit classifier that accepts handwritten digits from users and validates the correct handwritten digits by predicting the digits based on the trained samples. If predictions are right, accuracy falls between 0.5% to 1.0%, if prediction are false, accuracy falls between 0.1% to 0.49%.

## Build the demo using Android Studio

### Prerequisites

* If you don't have already, install **[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)**, following the instructions on the website.

* You need an Android device and Android development environment with minimum API 21.
* Android Studio 3.2 or later.

### Building
* Open Android Studio, and from the Welcome screen, select Open an existing Android Studio project.

* From the Open File or Project window that appears, navigate to and select the aloko001/handwritten_digit_classifier/android directory from wherever you cloned the TensorFlow Lite sample GitHub repo. Click OK.

* If it asks you to do a Gradle Sync, click OK.

* You may also need to install various platforms and tools, if you get errors like "Failed to find target with hash string 'android-21'" and similar.
Click the Run button (the green arrow) or select Run > Run 'android' from the top menu. You may need to rebuild the project using Build > Rebuild Project.

* If it asks you to use Instant Run, click Proceed Without Instant Run.

* Also, you need to have an Android device plugged in with developer options enabled at this point. See **[here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device)** for more details on setting up developer devices.
